# NYTimes truth data

To update these data run (in R):

    source("nytimes.R")
    
This will "copy" the appropriate files from the 
[NYTimes github repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/)
to [raw/](./raw).

Then it will wrangle the data into the same format as other truth data.
